See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

This example demonstrates turning on the fpu and using it to multiply
a couple of numbers.

    vmov s0,r0          ; copy the contents of r0 to s0
    vcvt.f32.u32 s0,s0  ; convert s0 from unsigned int to float
    vmov s1,r1          ; copy r1 to s1
    vcvt.f32.u32 s1,s1  ; convert s1 from unsigned int to float
    vmul.f32 s0,s0,s1   ; multiply s0 = s0 * s1
    vcvt.u32.f32 s0,s0  ; convert s0 from float to unsigned int
    vmov r0,s0          ; copy s0 to r0

Gnu assembler was complaining until I specified a -mfpu.

I think the right answer is

0x48435000

and it used to work but isnt now...
