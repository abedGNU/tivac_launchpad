See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

Derived from sharp01

This one is a gps clock receives 4800 baud nmea on uart3 rx.  And
then I broke the display, the ribbon underneath that connects
the display to the board, something is unhappy there.  Can get it to work
if I press on it, but not all the time.
