See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

Derived from uart06

This is a skeleton for uart based programs.

The main (external) oscillator is used instead of the internal (for
system not uart).  PLL is not used, runs at 16Mhz.  See uart06 for 80Mhz.
