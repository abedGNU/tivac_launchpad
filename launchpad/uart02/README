See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

Derived from uart01.  This is a good uart baseline, uart init, send,
receive.  This example echos whatever is received.

This does not modify the system clock, so the internal(?) clock
is used.
