See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

Derived from uart06

These are very cool.  I got one I think for the msp430 first and
messed with that and by design it works on the other launchpads
as well.

Sharp Memory LCD BoosterPack
30BOOST-SHARP96

Adafruit has a board with the same display for twice the money.

Can use the ti version of the display anywhere, doesnt have to be
on a launchpad, just shove some pins in.

Based on the LS013B4DN04 display from sharp.  It is as the Adafruit
page says somewhere between an e-ink and lcd display.  I still dont
know what the "memory" part of the display means maybe they do some
lower power trickery.  It is so low power I thought it was e-ink-ish
for a while, that with the power off it kept the same image, but
it was just the bulk capacitance from either/both of the boards, pulling
the power from the launchpad and the display stays "on" with whatever
was on there last.  But wait a while (minutes?) and it eventually drains
the storage and goes off.
