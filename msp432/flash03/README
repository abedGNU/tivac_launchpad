See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

same as flash02 but has even less stuff in the blinker binary turns
off WDT and thats it doesnt change the gpio.

Takes a few seconds to run, after running once, and reset/power cycle
to run the new flash.  you can uncomment uart_init(), set for 3MHz and
watch the output, if you didnt see it the first time.

I added this to the vector table

.thumb_func
.global _start
_start:
stacktop: .word 0x20001000
.word reset
.word 0x01000003
.word 0x01000005
.word 0x01000007
.word 0x01000009
.word 0x0100000B
.word 0x0100000D

So that sram based programs can use a branch (not branch link) to
hop to the handler.

.thumb_func
.global _start
_start:
    b reset
    b handler
    b handler
    b handler
    b handler
    b handler

I dont know if I added enough items in the vector table, each
cortex-m core and/or implementation potentially has a different number
of interrupts, I didnt do the research to find out how many I needed
here.  Was only after the systick initially which is very early in
the list.
